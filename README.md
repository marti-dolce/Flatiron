## Use the 'learn Gem' to test labs and submit code
The learn-co gem will run tests for you in the desktop development environment. 
It will let you test the labs.  

Navigate to your desktop development directory using the command line
Enter *'learn'* in the command console then hit the 
'enter key' to submit the lab.  [Link to Flatiron Video][1]

To submit the code, again, navigate to your desktop environment via the command console (on mac I use terminal). Now enter 'learn submit', then press the enter key on your keyboard.
